## Installation

### New application
When generating new charyf app, you can install wit intent processor automatically by specifying
``charyf new [app_nane] --intent-processors=wit``

### Existing application

To install wit processor to existing charyf application
Add gem to your gemfile
```ruby
gem 'adapt-charyf', '>= 0.2.4'
```

Edit *enabled_intent_processors* inside *config/application.rb*
```ruby
 config.enabled_intent_processors = [:wit, etc...]
```

Add the require inside inside *config/load.rb*
```ruby
require 'witai/charyf'
```

### Configure

If you dont set your api keys for wit application, the initialization will throw  
``/Users/rycco/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.2@charyf/gems/witai-charyf-0.2.0/lib/witai/charyf/processor.rb:18:in `initialize': WitAI::Charyf.api_key has not been set (WitAI::Charyf::Processor::NoKeyProvided)``

To configure create file *config/initializers/witai.rb* and set the API key
```ruby
require 'witai/charyf'

WitAI::Charyf::Extension.configure do
  config.api_key = 'SOME_CLIENT_API_KEY'
end     
```
